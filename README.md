# ClauseCraft – AI-Powered Contract Intelligence

ClauseCraft is an end-to-end Contract Intelligence platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and structured information extraction to automate legal contract analysis.

The system enables users to upload contracts in multiple formats, extract key legal entities, answer natural language questions with clause-level citations, identify potential legal risks, and compare contracts side by side.

---

## Problem Statement

Legal teams spend a significant amount of time manually reviewing contracts to identify:

- Parties involved
- Governing law
- Contract duration
- Termination clauses
- Liability limits
- Indemnification
- Non-compete clauses
- Other legal obligations

ClauseCraft aims to reduce this manual effort by providing an AI-powered assistant capable of understanding legal documents with explainable, citation-backed responses.

## Key Features

### Document Ingestion

- PDF support
- DOCX support
- Scanned contract OCR support

### Document Processing

- Text extraction
- Metadata extraction
- Clause-aware chunking
- Semantic chunking

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Dense retrieval
- Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector Search)
- Re-ranking
- Inline clause citations
- Confidence scoring
- Hallucination guard

### Structured Extraction

Extract important legal entities including:

- Parties
- Effective Date
- Expiration Date
- Governing Law
- Contract Term
- Termination Clause
- Liability Cap
- Indemnification
- Confidentiality
- Payment Terms

using schema-validated JSON outputs.

### Risk Analysis

Automatically classify clauses into risk categories such as:

- Unlimited Liability
- Broad Indemnity
- Auto Renewal
- Intellectual Property Assignment
- Non-Compete
- Termination Risk
- Jurisdiction Risk
- Confidentiality Risk

### Contract Comparison

Compare two contracts and highlight:

- Added clauses
- Removed clauses
- Modified clauses
- Risk differences

### Evaluation

Evaluate system performance using:

- Exact Match
- Citation Precision
- Hallucination Rate
- Retrieval Accuracy

- Hybrid retrieval
- Citation generation

### Week 3

- Structured extraction
- Risk classification
- Contract comparison

### Week 4

---

## Current Progress

### Completed

- Repository initialized
- End-to-end contract ingestion pipeline added
- PDF and DOCX parsing support implemented
- Basic contract text extraction and display flow verified
- Robust PDF loading fallback added to avoid startup failures when PyMuPDF is unavailable or interrupted

### How to Run

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the sample pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Notes

- The project now supports reading the bundled NDA sample from the data folder.
- If PyMuPDF fails to import, the application will gracefully fall back to a secondary PDF reader path so the contract can still be processed.
- The repository is ready for further enhancements such as OCR, RAG, extraction, and evaluation modules.
- Project architecture designed
- Folder structure organized
- Development environment configured
- Dependency list prepared
- Configuration files added
- Documentation created
- Dataset directory initialized

### In Progress

- Contract collection
- Parser implementation

### Upcoming

- PDF parsing
- OCR pipeline
- RAG pipeline
- Structured extraction
- Risk analysis
- Evaluation framework
